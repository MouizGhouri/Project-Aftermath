#Variables

  One of the most important concepts in programming is the concept of ‘variables’. In programming, a variable is an entity that is changeable, but in terms of what ? In Pawn language a variable holds a ‘value’ at any time and that value-as the name suggests-is ‘variable’ or ‘changeable’.

  The reason why variables are so important is because they are basically small units of computer memory which can hold or ‘remember’ different values while the program is under execution (running), and that property turns out to be very useful in programming. For example, you want to keep track of the scores of 100 players in a game, you can do it easily by programming the computer to store (remember) and update those values. Later if you want to find the mean score of those players or want to create a leaderboard, those values from the variables can be easily accessed and used for that purpose.

```c
// Creating (more appropriately, 'declaring') a variable named 'my_variable'

new my_variable ;

// The 'new' keyword is used for declaring a variable
// In the above line a variable is declared with the name 'my_variable'
// Semi-colon is used in the end to close the declaration statement.
```
